# Pose Evaluation

This repository provides tools and metrics for the automatic evaluation of pose sequences,
specifically designed for sign language applications.

This includes metrics proposed by Ham2Pose[^1] as well as custom-developed metrics unique to our approach.
We recognize the distinct challenges in evaluating single signs versus continuous signing,
and our methods reflect this differentiation.

## Usage

Install the package:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/sign-language-processing/pose-evaluation.git
```

Create a metric:

```python
from pose_evaluation.metrics.distance_metric import DistanceMetric
from pose_evaluation.metrics.dtw_metric import DTWDTAIImplementationDistanceMeasure
from pose_evaluation.metrics.pose_processors import *

DTWp = DistanceMetric(
    name="DTWp",
    # Select distance measure
    distance_measure=DTWDTAIImplementationDistanceMeasure(),
    # Provide pose processing pipeline
    pose_preprocessors=[
        TrimMeaninglessFramesPoseProcessor(),
        GetHandsOnlyHolisticPoseProcessor(), # select only the hands
        FillMaskedOrInvalidValuesPoseProcessor(masked_fill_value=10.0), # fill masked values with 10.0
        ReducePosesToCommonComponentsProcessor() # reduce pairs of poses to common components
    ],
)
```

Evaluate two pose sequences:

```python
from pose_format import Pose

with open("hypothesis.pose", "rb") as f:
    hypothesis = Pose.read(f)

with open("reference.pose", "rb") as f:
    reference = Pose.read(f)

DTWp.score(hypothesis, reference)
```

### Demo Notebook

For a demonstration of how to use the package, see the
[demo notebook](examples/Pose_Evaluation_Example.ipynb):

</a>

Demonstrates:

- How to reconstruct the metrics from our paper.
- How to use them to score poses, with signatures.
- How to score poses with different lengths, missing/undetected keypoints, or different keypoint formats.
